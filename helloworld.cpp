#include <iostream> // is a header file library that lets us work with input and output object : eg- cout
using namespace std; // means we can use names for object and variables in the programs


int main()           // this is the name function, code inside these brackets will be executed    
{
    cout<<"Hello C++ World"; // cout (pronounced as "See-out") is an object used together with insertion operator(<<) to outputlprint text
    return 0;
}
// every statment or line in c++ ends with a  semicolon ;
//return 0; ends the main function
// don't forget to add an curely bracket to actually end the main program
